<main id="content">

<p><span class="header">Does Mr. Frac&eacute; still paint?</span>
<br>Mr. Frac&eacute; retired from painting and the print business in 1996 and passed away December 16, 2005.</p>

<p><span class="header">Why are there no prices on the website?</span>
<br>If you are interested in purchasing an item, please <a href="mailto:info@fracewildlifeart.com">contact us</a> and we will provide you with pricing information.</p>

<p><span class="header">I am interested in selling some of my collection. Do you buy prints?</span>
<br>No. We are not a gallery and are only selling prints from the collection of the late Mr. Frac&eacute;.</p>

<p><span class="header">I run an art gallery. Are your items available at wholesale?</span>
<br>Yes. Please <a href="mailto:info@fracewildlifeart.com">contact us</a> with your name and gallery information and we will provide you with pricing information.</p>

<p><span class="header">Are all of Mr. Frac&eacute;'s prints listed on this site?</span>
<br>No. We are currently working on getting all of Mr. Frac&eacute;'s work listed on the site as well as their availability for purchase.</p>

<p><span class="header">How does the Search work?</span>
<br>The Search field searches both the painting title and subject matter, so if you know the title of the print you're looking for, such as "Royal Pride," you can type that, or you can simply type "lion" and see all of the paintings that Mr. Frac&eacute; did of a lion or lions. Similarly, the search field will provide auto-complete links for titles matching your query.</p>

<p><span class="header">Do you take credit cards?</span>
<br>Not at this time. You will need to pay with a money order, cashier's check or a personal check.</p>
