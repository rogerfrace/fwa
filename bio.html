<h1>About Charles Frac&eacute;</h1>

<p><b>Charles Frac&eacute;</b> was born in 1926 in a small town in eastern Pennsylvania. He began drawing at five and taught himself to paint when he was fifteen. Frac&eacute; remembers wanting to be an artist from an early age. His self-instructed talent earned him a scholarship to Philadelphia's Museum School of Art, where he graduated with honors.</p>

<p>In 1955, Frac&eacute; began a professional career as a freelance illustrator in New York City. Eventually, he became one of the nation's most sought-after illustrators of wildlife. However, Frac&eacute; soon grew frustrated by the restrictions of illustrating ideas conceived by others and longed to paint some of his own. He finished only one, which his wife, Elke, took to a nearby art gallery. They insisted on displaying the painting in the gallery, and it sold that same afternoon.</p>

<p>In 1973, with the issue of Frac&eacute;'s first limited edition print, he had finally made the permanent change to fine art. Frac&eacute; brings to his art over three decades of personal research and a close kinship with animals. Frac&eacute; and his art has been the subject of two books.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest honor of his career came in October 1992, when Frac&eacute; was recognized with a one-man exhibit of thirty-six of his paintings at the National Museum of Natural History of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Charles Frac&eacute; passed away December 16, 2005 after a long illness. Mr. Frac&eacute;'s legacy will continue to live on in his masterful work which has captivated art collectors and intrigued nature experts for over thirty years.</p>

<h2>The Anatomy of a Painting</h2>
<h3><i>Royal Pride</i> in the Rough.</h3>
<p>This photographic sequence reveals something few people have ever seen&mdash;the evolution of a Charles Frac&eacute; painting.</p>
<p><i>Royal Pride</i> began as all Frac&eacute; paintings do&mdash;as a rough sketch, one arrived at after actual field research and lengthy experiments in composition. The sketch is transfered to the artist's canvas and painted in stages. </p>
<p>A Frac&eacute; painting is a building process, with one thin layer of paint over another, creating depth and contour. The latter layers, or stages, are the "icing on the cake"&mdash;subtle shadows and fine detail that make Mr. Frac&eacute;'s creatures look so alive and engaging. </p>
<p>The fifth image in the sequence is the final result.</p>
